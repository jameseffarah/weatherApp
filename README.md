# weatherApp Project

Just a simple weather app that showcased my React.js & Redux progress.

### How to use weatherApp

1. Type in a city. 
2. Dress accordingly.

#### Key learning points from this project:
I learned the basics of React & Redux as well as how to vizualize a wireframe before implementing any code.

```
> Learned when to use containers vs. components and how to connect React to Redux.
> Learned how to utilize middlewares and pull API data from Google Maps and openweathermap.org.
> Understood the basic concepts of reducers and how they work with data, states, and actions.
> Learned how to extend React { Component } with containers (searchBar, weatherList) and components (googleMaps, Chart).
```

Enjoy!
